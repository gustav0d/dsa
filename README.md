# Data structures and algorithms

I am using this repo to study data structures and algorithms.


## Roadmap

1. [Stacks](./src/stacks/index.md)
2. Queues and deque (double-ended queue)
3. Linked Lists
4. Sets
5. Dictionaries and hashes
6. Sort algorithms
7. Search algorithms
8. Trees
9. Binary heap and heap sort
10. Graphs
11. Algorithms design
12. Complexity

## How to run

### Dependencies

- [Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/) ^20.17.0
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation) (optional, you can use your preferred package manager such as `npm` or `yarn`)

### Run tests

```sh
pnpm test
```

- run in watch mode:
```sh
pnpm test:watch
```
